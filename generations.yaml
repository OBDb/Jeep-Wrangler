generations:
  - name: "First Generation (YJ)"
    start_year: 1986
    end_year: 1995
    description: "The original Wrangler replaced the CJ (Civilian Jeep) series, maintaining its predecessor's open-top, off-road focus but with improved on-road comfort and safety features. Distinguished by its rectangular headlights (controversial among purists), the YJ featured a wider track, lower ride height, and leaf springs on all four corners. Powertrain options included AMC's 2.5L four-cylinder and 4.2L inline-six engines, the latter replaced by a fuel-injected 4.0L version in 1991. Transmission choices included manual and automatic options, with part-time Command-Trac four-wheel drive standard. The interior was basic but more civilized than the CJ's, with improved seats, better instrumentation, and available features like air conditioning. Notable variants included the upscale Laredo, Islander with tropical-themed graphics, and Renegade with wider fender flares and distinctive styling elements. The YJ established the Wrangler nameplate while bridging the gap between the purely utilitarian CJs and more user-friendly later generations."

  - name: "Second Generation (TJ)"
    start_year: 1996
    end_year: 2006
    description: "The TJ Wrangler marked a significant evolution, reintroducing round headlights and adding coil spring suspension on all four corners—a major improvement for both on and off-road ride quality. The exterior maintained classic Jeep design elements while offering improved weather protection with a more substantial soft top and an available hard top. Powertrain options continued with the 2.5L four-cylinder (later replaced by a 2.4L) and the venerable 4.0L inline-six. The interior featured improved ergonomics, better safety features including dual airbags, and more comfort options. In 2003, the Rubicon model was introduced with premium off-road equipment including Dana 44 axles, 4:1 low-range transfer case, air lockers, and 31-inch tires. The Unlimited model debuted in 2004, offering a longer wheelbase with additional cargo space but still in a two-door configuration. This generation significantly improved the Wrangler's daily usability while enhancing its legendary off-road capability."

  - name: "Third Generation (JK)"
    start_year: 2007
    end_year: 2018
    description: "The JK represented the most substantial Wrangler redesign in decades, introducing the four-door Unlimited model that dramatically expanded its appeal to families and everyday users. Significantly wider than its predecessor, it featured a more modern interior with improved materials, better safety features, and enhanced creature comforts. Initially powered by a 3.8L V6 (replaced by the more efficient 3.6L Pentastar V6 in 2012), it offered improved on-road performance while maintaining off-road capability. Available with Command-Trac or Rock-Trac four-wheel drive systems and electronic locking differentials on Rubicon models. The modular top design allowed for various open-air configurations, maintaining the Wrangler's signature open-top experience. Throughout its long production run, numerous special editions were offered with unique styling and equipment packages. The JK's introduction of the four-door model proved transformative for the Wrangler, dramatically increasing sales and expanding its appeal beyond hardcore off-road enthusiasts to mainstream consumers seeking an adventurous image with practical versatility."

  - name: "Fourth Generation (JL)"
    start_year: 2018
    end_year: null
    description: "The current Wrangler maintains its iconic design and off-road capability while offering significant improvements in refinement, technology, and efficiency. Available in two-door and four-door Unlimited models, it features improved aerodynamics, weight reduction through aluminum doors, hood, and windshield frame, and a fold-down windshield that's easier to operate. Powertrain options expanded considerably, including a standard 3.6L Pentastar V6 (available with mild-hybrid eTorque system), a 2.0L turbocharged four-cylinder, a 3.0L EcoDiesel V6, and the 4xe plug-in hybrid combining a 2.0L turbo with electric motors for 375 HP and approximately 21 miles of electric range. The 6.4L V8-powered Rubicon 392 delivers 470 HP and 470 lb-ft of torque. The interior represents a major advancement with higher quality materials, improved ergonomics, and modern technology including available 8.4-inch Uconnect touchscreen, forward-facing off-road camera, and comprehensive driver assistance features. Off-road capability remains paramount with up to 11.1 inches of ground clearance, improved approach and departure angles, enhanced Dana axles, and electronic sway bar disconnect. The Rubicon model continues as the factory-optimized off-road variant. Despite these modernizations, the JL maintains traditional Wrangler elements including the removable doors, roof options (soft top, hard top, or power Sky One-Touch), and fold-down windshield—preserving the open-air experience that defines the model while offering unprecedented levels of comfort, technology, and powertrain efficiency."
